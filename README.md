# go-btfs

## What is BTFS?

BitTorrent File Sharing (BTFS) is a file-sharing protocol forked from 
IPFS that utilizes the TRON network for integration with DApps and smart 
contracts. In current smart-contract based networks like Ethereum and NEO, 
there exists no mechanism for large file transfer. BTFS allows for 
tokenized large file transfers. This paper presents a proposal for a BTFS 
and TRON based decentralized social media DApp which is censorship 
resistant and implements a tokenized reward system to content creators.

## Install

### System Requirements

BTFS can run on most Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. We recommend 
running it on a machine with at least 2 GB of RAM (it’ll do fine with 
only one CPU core), but it should run fine with as little as 1 GB of 
RAM. On systems with less memory, it may not be completely stable.
Only support compiling from source for mac and unix-based system.


### Build from Source

#### Step0 Install GCC
GCC is required to build btfs from source code. Approaches to install GCC may vary from operating system to operating system.
To install GCC on Debian and Ubuntu system, please run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential manpages-dev
```
To verify that GCC has been successfully installed on your machine, please run this command:
```bash
gcc --version
```

#### Step1 Install Go

The build process for btfs requires Go 1.12 or higher. If you don't 
have it: [Download Go 1.12+](https://golang.org/dl/). Or use the 
following command:
```
cd /tmp
GO_PACKAGE=go1.12.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
wget https://golang.org/dl/$GO_PACKAGE
sudo tar -xvf $GO_PACKAGE
sudo mv go /usr/local
sudo rm $GO_PACKAGE
go version
```

You'll need to add Go's bin directories to your `$PATH` environment 
variable e.g., by adding these lines to your `/etc/profile` (for a 
system-wide installation) or `$HOME/.profile`:

```
export GOPATH=${HOME}/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
export GO111MODULE=on
```

(If you run into trouble, see the [Go install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)).


#### Step2 Access To Private Repo
Firstly, you need your github token to access the private github repo. If you don't have a github token, following the guide [Generate github token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to get your github token.

Put your github token to git config:
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=(Your github token)
git config --global url."https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}:x-oauth-basic@github.com/TRON-US".insteadOf "https://github.com/TRON-US"
```


#### Step3 Download Source Code

```
$ git clone https://github.com/TRON-US/go-btfs.git
$ cd go-btfs
```


#### Step4 Build And Join BTFS Private Net

Your can choose to using on-step script to compile and build or just follow step by step.

##### Using One-step Script

`bash install_btfs.sh`


##### Step-by-step Instruction

###### 1. Compile and build:

```
$ make install
go version go1.12.4 linux/amd64
bin/check_go_version 1.12
go install -ldflags="-X "github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs".CurrentCommit=63ae486fa-dirty" ./cmd/btfs
```
If you are building on FreeBSD instead of `make install` use `gmake install`.

Show if btfs exec file has been created:
```
$which btfs
/home/ubuntu/go/bin/btfs
```

###### 2. Init a btfs node:

```
$ btfs init
initializing BTFS node at /home/ubuntu/.btfs
generating 2048-bit ECDSA keypair...done
peer identity: QmTkQjKAtfh2GNDPmtnFB8d..................
to get started, enter:

        btfs cat /btfs/QmS4ustL54uo8FzR9455qaxZwuMi........H4uVv/readme
```

###### 3. Auto Update Setting

Create a config.yaml file in the same path of your btfs binary path. The config.yaml file has the following context:
```
version: 0.0.4    # btfs version, order by version.go
md5: 034cf64b76f8bf5f506ce6aca9fa81c4    #btfs binary md5
autoupdateFlg: true     # is auto update
sleepTimeSeconds: 20        # how often to auto update (second）.
```

###### 4. Join BTFS Private Net

Put the swarm.key in /.btfs, and then run the node. [Get swarm.key](https://github.com/TRON-US/go-btfs/blob/master/swarm.key)
```
$ mv swarm.key ~/.btfs/swarm.key
```
Remove ipfs bootstrap:
```
$ btfs bootstrap rm --all  (if there is error like this: Error: cannot 
connect to the api. Is the daemon running? To run as a standalone CLI 
command remove the api file in `$IPFS_PATH/api`, please run `nohup btfs 
daemon </dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1 &` and then run this command.)
```
Join the private net work:
```
$ btfs bootstrap add /ip4/3.18.120.107/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmcmRdAHQYTtpbs9Ud5rNx6WzHmU9WcYCrBneCSyKhMr7H
added /ip4/3.18.120.107/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmcmRdAHQYTtpbs9Ud5rNx6WzHmU9WcYCrBneCSyKhMr7H
```
Announce your public ip address to btfs network:
You can get your public ip address through online browsing or run "curl https://ipinfo.io/ip"
```
# for example, your public ip4 address is: 38.142.72.82
$ btfs config --json Addresses.Announce  '["/ip4/38.142.72.82/tcp/4001"]'
```
Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing:
```
$ btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin "[\"*\"]"
$ btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Methods '["PUT", "GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"]'
$ btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "[\"true\"]"
```
Enable gateway, api port:
```
$ btfs config Addresses.API /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/5001
$ btfs config Addresses.Gateway /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8080
```


#### Step5 Run BTFS At The Backend

```
you need to make sure there is no btfs node already running, using `ps -ef |grep "btfs daemon"` to check if there is btfs node running and then kill the node process if it is, then running the following command:
$ sudo nohup btfs daemon </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```
Check if your node is connect to BTFS private net:
```
$ btfs swarm peers
/ip4/3.18.120.107/tcp/4001/btfs/QmcmRdAHQYTtpbs9Ud5rNx6WzHmU9WcYCrBneCSyKhMr7H
```

## Started by binary file

Please refer to the documentation for the btfs-binary-releases project.

[btfs-binary-releases](https://github.com/TRON-US/btfs-binary-releases/blob/master/README.md)

### Automatically generate

#### Pay attention

* This section is limited to maintenance personnel of btfs-binary-release.
* Make sure go-btfs and btfs-binary-release are in the same directory.

#### Step

1. Download go-btfs and btfs-binary-release repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TRON-US/go-btfs.git
git clone https://github.com/TRON-US/btfs-binary-releases.git
```

2. Create a branch to upload in btfs-binary-release.

```shell
cd btfs-binary-releases
git checkout -b uploader
```

3. Execute automatic packaging script.

```shell
cd ../go-btfs
bash package.sh
```

Now you will generate all supported versions of the binary package. Push it to the remote to generate the pull request, we will review your pr and merge it into the master.

## Getting Started

To start using BTFS, you must first initialize BTFS's config files on your
system, this is done with `btfs init`. See `btfs init --help` for information on
the optional arguments it takes. After initialization is complete, you can use
`btfs mount`, `btfs add` and any of the other commands to explore!


### Some things to try

Basic proof of 'btfs working' locally:

	echo "hello world" > hello
	btfs add hello
	# This should output a hash string that looks something like:
	# QmT78zSuBmuS4z925WZfrqQ1qHaJ56DQaTfyMUF7F8ff5o
	btfs cat <that hash>

### Testing

```
make test
```

### Development Dependencies

If you make changes to the protocol buffers, you will need to install the [protoc compiler](https://github.com/google/protobuf).

## What is BTFS?


BitTorrent File System (BTFS) is a protocol forked from 
IPFS that utilizes the TRON network and the BitTorrent Ecosystem for integration with DApps and smart 
contracts. 

* The <a href="https://docs.btfs.io/" target="_blank">API documentation</a> walks developers through BTFS setup, usage, and API references.

## Install

The download and install instructions for BTFS are over at: https://docs.btfs.io/docs/btfs-demo. 

### System Requirements

BTFS can run on most Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. We recommend 
running it on a machine with at least 2 GB of RAM (it’ll do fine with 
only one CPU core), but it should run fine with as little as 1 GB of 
RAM. On systems with less memory, it may not be completely stable.
Only support compiling from source for mac and unix-based system.

### Install Pre-Built Packages

We host pre-built binaries at https://github.com/TRON-US/btfs-binary-releases. 

#### Initialize a BTFS Daemon

```
$ btfs init
initializing BTFS node at /home/ubuntu/.btfs
generating 2048-bit keypair...done
peer identity: 16Uiu2HAmHmW9mHcE9c5UfUomy8caBuEgJVP99MDb4wFtzF8URgzE
to get started, enter:

        btfs cat /btfs/QmPbWqakofrBdDSm4mLUS5RE5QiPQi8JbnK73LgWwQNdbi/readme
```

#### Start the Daemon

Start the BTFS Daemon
```
$ btfs daemon
```

## Build from Source

### MacOS

Clone the go-btfs repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/TRON-US/go-btfs
```

Navigate to the go-btfs directory and run `make install`.
```
$ cd go-btfs
$ make install
```

A successful make install outputs something like:
```
$ make install
go: downloading github.com/tron-us/go-btfs-common v0.2.28
go: extracting github.com/tron-us/go-btfs-common v0.2.28
go: finding github.com/tron-us/go-btfs-common v0.2.28
go version go1.14.1 darwin/amd64
bin/check_go_version 1.14
bash patching.sh
go install  "-asmflags=all='-trimpath='" "-gcflags=all='-trimpath='" -ldflags="-X "github.com/TRON-US/go-btfs".CurrentCommit=e4848946d" ./cmd/btfs
```

Afterwards, run `btfs init` and `btfs daemon` to initialize and start the daemon. 

### Linux VM

Developers wishing to run a BTFS daemon on a Linux VM should first set up the environment. On an AWS EC2 Linux machine for example, it would be helpful to first install the following tools and dependencies:
```
$ sudo yum update          // Installs general updates for Linux
$ sudo yum install git     // Lets you git clone the go-btfs repository
$ sudo yum install patch   // Required for building from source
$ sudo yum install gcc     // Required for building from source
```

Building BTFS from source requires Go 1.14 or higher. To install from the terminal:
```
$ cd /tmp
$ GO_PACKAGE=go1.14.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ wget https://golang.org/dl/$GO_PACKAGE
$ sudo tar -xvf $GO_PACKAGE
$ sudo mv go /usr/local
$ sudo rm $GO_PACKAGE
```

Navigate back to root directory and set the Go Path in the environment variables: 
```
$ export GOPATH=${HOME}/go
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
$ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
$ export GO111MODULE=on
```

Verify the Go version is 1.14 or higher:
```
$ go version
```

Navigate to the go-btfs directory and run `make install`.
```
$ cd go-btfs
$ make install
```

Afterwards, run `btfs init` and `btfs daemon` to initialize and start the daemon. To re-initialize a new pair of keys, you can shut down the daemon first via `btfs shutdown`. Then run `rm -r .btfs` and `btfs init` again. 

### Docker

Developers also have the option to build a BTFS daemon within a Docker container. After cloning the go-btfs repository, navigate into the go-btfs directory. This is where the Dockerfile is located. Build the docker image:
```
$ cd go-btfs
$ docker image build -t btfs_docker .   // Builds the docker image and tags "btfs_docker" as the name 
```

A successful build should have an output like:
```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.789MB
Step 1/37 : FROM golang:1.14-stretch
 ---> 4fe257ac564c
Step 2/37 : MAINTAINER TRON-US <support@tron.network>
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 02409001f528

...

Step 37/37 : CMD ["daemon", "--migrate=true"]
 ---> Running in 3660f91dce94
Removing intermediate container 3660f91dce94
 ---> b4e1523cf264
Successfully built b4e1523cf264
Successfully tagged btfs_docker:latest
```

Start the container based on the new image. Starting the container also initializes and starts the BTFS daemon.
```
$ docker container run --publish 5001:8080 --detach --name btfs1 btfs_docker
```

The CLI flags are as such:

* `--publish` asks Docker to forward traffic incoming on the host’s port 5001, to the container’s port 8080. 
* `--detach` asks Docker to run this container in the background.
* `--name` specifies a name with which you can refer to your container in subsequent commands, in this case btfs1.

Execute commands within the docker container:
```
docker exec CONTAINER btfs add chunker=reed-solomon FILE
```

## Getting Started

### Some things to try

Basic proof of 'btfs working' locally:

	echo "hello world" > hello
	btfs add hello
	# This should output a hash string that looks something like:
	# QmT78zSuBmuS4z925WZfrqQ1qHaJ56DQaTfyMUF7F8ff5o
	btfs cat <that hash>

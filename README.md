## What is BTFS?

BitTorrent File System (BTFS) is a protocol forked from 
IPFS that utilizes the TRON network and the BitTorrent Ecosystem for integration with DApps and smart 
contracts. The <a href="https://docs.btfs.io/" target="_blank">API documentation</a> walks developers through BTFS setup, usage, and contains all the API references.

## Install

The download and install instructions for BTFS are over at: https://docs.btfs.io/docs/btfs-demo. 

### System Requirements

BTFS can run on most Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. We recommend 
running it on a machine with at least 2 GB of RAM (itâ€™ll do fine with 
only one CPU core), but it should run fine with as little as 1 GB of 
RAM. On systems with less memory, it may not be completely stable.
Only support compiling from source for mac and unix-based system.

### Install Pre-Built Packages

We host pre-built binaries at https://github.com/TRON-US/btfs-binary-releases. 

#### Initialize a BTFS Daemon

```
$ btfs init
initializing BTFS node at /home/ubuntu/.btfs
generating 2048-bit keypair...done
peer identity: 16Uiu2HAmHmW9mHcE9c5UfUomy8caBuEgJVP99MDb4wFtzF8URgzE
to get started, enter:

        btfs cat /btfs/QmPbWqakofrBdDSm4mLUS5RE5QiPQi8JbnK73LgWwQNdbi/readme
```

#### Start the Daemon

Start the BTFS Daemon
```
$ btfs daemon
```

```

## Getting Started

### Some things to try

Basic proof of 'btfs working' locally:

	echo "hello world" > hello
	btfs add hello
	# This should output a hash string that looks something like:
	# QmT78zSuBmuS4z925WZfrqQ1qHaJ56DQaTfyMUF7F8ff5o
	btfs cat <that hash>


## Development

Some places to get you started on the codebase:

- Main file: [./cmd/btfs/main.go](https://github.com/TRON-US/go-btfs/blob/master/cmd/btfs/main.go)
- CLI Commands: [./core/commands/](https://github.com/TRON-US/go-btfs/tree/master/core/commands)
- libp2p
  - libp2p: [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p)
  - DHT: [DHT](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht)
  - PubSub: [PubSub](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub)


### Development Dependencies

If you make changes to the protocol buffers, you will need to install the [protoc compiler](https://github.com/google/protobuf).

### Soter

BTFS Soter is a charging service gateway based on the TRON Network and BTFS cluster. Users can access the BTFS network via the Soter gateway.

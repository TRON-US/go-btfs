# go-btfs

## What is BTFS?

BitTorrent File Sharing (BTFS) is a file-sharing protocol forked from IPFS that utilizes the TRON network for integration with DApps and smart contracts. In current smart-contract based networks like Ethereum and NEO, there exists no mechanism for large file transfer. BTFS allows for tokenized large file transfers. This paper presents a proposal for a BTFS and TRON based decentralized social media DApp which is censorship resistant and implements a tokenized reward system to content creators.

## Install
### System Requirements

BTFS can run on most Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. We recommend running it on a machine with at least 2 GB of RAM (itâ€™ll do fine with only one CPU core), but it should run fine with as little as 1 GB of RAM. On systems with less memory, it may not be completely stable.


### Build from Source

#### Install Go

The build process for btfs requires Go 1.11 or higher. If you don't have it: [Download Go 1.12+](https://golang.org/dl/). Or use the following command:
```
cd /tmp
GO_PACKAGE=go1.12.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
wget https://golang.org/dl/$GO_PACKAGE
sudo tar -xvf $GO_PACKAGE
sudo mv go /usr/local
sudo rm $GO_PACKAGE
go version
```

You'll need to add Go's bin directories to your `$PATH` environment variable e.g., by adding these lines to your `/etc/profile` (for a system-wide installation) or `$HOME/.profile`:

```
export GOPATH=${HOME}/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

(If you run into trouble, see the [Go install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)).


#### Environment setting

```
export GO111MODULE=on
export EDITOR=vim
export GITHUB_TOKEN=9e2b088b6091e4452696aac6503f30d4c16c7c7c
```


#### Download and Compile BTFS

```
$ git clone https://github.com/TRON-US/go-btfs.git
$ cd go-btfs
$ git config --global url."https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}:x-oauth-basic@github.com/TRON-US".insteadOf "https://github.com/TRON-US"
$ make install
go version go1.12.4 linux/amd64
bin/check_go_version 1.12
go install -ldflags="-X "github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs".CurrentCommit=63ae486fa-dirty" ./cmd/btfs
```
If you are building on FreeBSD instead of `make install` use `gmake install`.

Show if btfs exec file has been created:
```
$which btfs
/home/ubuntu/go/bin/btfs
```
Init a btfs node:
```
$ btfs init
initializing BTFS node at /home/ubuntu/.btfs

to get started, enter:

        btfs cat /btfs/QmS4ustL54uo8FzR9455qaxZwuMi........H4uVv/readme
```


#### Running a btfs node on local:
```
$ btfs daemon
Initializing daemon...

```


#### Running a btfs node on btfs private net:
Put the swarm.key in /.btfs, and then run the node. [How to generate swarm.key](https://github.com/Kubuxu/go-ipfs-swarm-key-gen)
```
mv swarm.key /.btfs
btfs daemon
```


#### Troubleshooting

- Separate [instructions are available for building on Windows](docs/windows.md).
- Also, [instructions for OpenBSD](docs/openbsd.md).
- `git` is required in order for `go get` to fetch all dependencies.
- Package managers often contain out-of-date `golang` packages.
  Ensure that `go version` reports at least 1.10. See above for how to install go.
- If you are interested in development, please install the development
dependencies as well.
- _WARNING_: Older versions of OSX FUSE (for Mac OS X) can cause kernel panics when mounting!-
  We strongly recommend you use the [latest version of OSX FUSE](http://osxfuse.github.io/).
  (See https://github.com/btfs/go-btfs/issues/177)
- For more details on setting up FUSE (so that you can mount the filesystem), see the docs folder.
- Shell command completion is available in `misc/completion/btfs-completion.bash`. Read [docs/command-completion.md](docs/command-completion.md) to learn how to install it.

  environment variable:
  
    export BTFS_PATH=/path/to/btfsrepo
```

## Getting Started

See also: http://btfs.io/docs/getting-started/

To start using BTFS, you must first initialize BTFS's config files on your
system, this is done with `btfs init`. See `btfs init --help` for information on
the optional arguments it takes. After initialization is complete, you can use
`btfs mount`, `btfs add` and any of the other commands to explore!

### Some things to try

Basic proof of 'btfs working' locally:

	echo "hello world" > hello
	btfs add hello
	# This should output a hash string that looks something like:
	# QmT78zSuBmuS4z925WZfrqQ1qHaJ56DQaTfyMUF7F8ff5o
	btfs cat <that hash>


### Troubleshooting

If you have previously installed BTFS before and you are running into problems getting a newer version to work, try deleting (or backing up somewhere else) your BTFS config directory (~/.btfs by default) and rerunning `btfs init`. This will reinitialize the config file to its defaults and clear out the local datastore of any bad entries.

		ShortDescription: `
Multihashes are hard to remember, but domain names are usually easy to
remember.  To create memorable aliases for multihashes, DNS TXT
records can point to other DNS links, BTFS objects, IPNS keys, etc.
This command resolves those links to the referenced object.

		LongDescription: `
Multihashes are hard to remember, but domain names are usually easy to
remember.  To create memorable aliases for multihashes, DNS TXT
records can point to other DNS links, BTFS objects, IPNS keys, etc.
This command resolves those links to the referenced object.

Note: This command can only recursively resolve DNS links,
it will fail to recursively resolve through IPNS keys etc.
For general-purpose recursive resolution, use btfs name resolve -r.

For example, with this DNS TXT record:

	> dig +short TXT _dnslink.ipfs.io
	dnslink=/btfs/QmRzTuh2Lpuz7Gr39stNr6mTFdqAghsZec1JoUnfySUzcy

The resolver will give:

	> btfs dns ipfs.io
	/btfs/QmRzTuh2Lpuz7Gr39stNr6mTFdqAghsZec1JoUnfySUzcy

The resolver can recursively resolve:

	> dig +short TXT recursive.ipfs.io
	dnslink=/ipns/ipfs.io
	> btfs dns -r recursive.ipfs.io
	/btfs/QmRzTuh2Lpuz7Gr39stNr6mTFdqAghsZec1JoUnfySUzcy
